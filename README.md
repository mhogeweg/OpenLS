# OpenLS connector for ArcGIS Server services.

## What is OpenLS?

The OpenGIS Open Location Services Interface Standard (OpenLS) specifies interfaces that enable 
companies in the Location Based Services (LBS) value chain to “hook up” and provide their pieces 
of applications such as emergency response (E-911, for example), personal navigator, traffic 
information service, proximity service, location recall, mobile field service, travel directions, 
restaurant finder, corporate asset locator, concierge, routing, vector map portrayal and interaction, 
friend finder, and geography voice-graphics. These applications are enabled by interfaces that 
implement OpenLS services such as a Directory Service, Gateway Service, Geocoder Service, 
Presentation (Map Portrayal) Service and others.

The OpenLS connector for ArcGIS Server enables the OGC interfaces on existing ArcGIS Server services for mapping,
geocoding, routing, etc.
